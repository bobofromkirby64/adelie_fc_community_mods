-- objects/roundelie.lua
-- v0.8.0

-- Movement Documentation:
-- Z to jump, left and right arrow keys to move
-- X + Up causes a small midair "bounce" slightly smaller than a jump. 
--   Can be done up to 3 times before touching the ground
--   Was changed to have no cooldown between uses (but the parameter to adjust cooldown time was not removed)
-- X + Down causes roundelie to accelerate downward quickly while held
--   Has a top speed higher than the regular terminal velocity
--   Has a hitbox that pushes opponents downward, which may "trap" them as they fall
--     - There's a 1f delay before the hitbox comes out, and an initial burst of speed is applied after the delay
--     - The hitbox remains active as long as the input is held, or until roundelie collides a wall or with the ground
--   If X + Down is held when roundelie hits a wall, roundelie bounces back and upward off the wall
--   (ie in the direction opposite roundelie's facing direction, not necessarily away from the wall)
--   If X + Down is held when roundelie hits ground, roundelie bounces back and upward off the ground and sends out a shockwave
--     Roundelie's bounce and the shockwave are larger if roundelie hits the ground at the max speed of the down + x attack
--     The shockwave does upward knockback to all opponents at ground height and somewhat close to roundelie laterally
--     The shockwave is slightly offset laterally in the direction roundelie was facing when they hit the ground
--     This hitbox is also marked by particles for clarity
-- X + Left/Right/Nothing causes roundelie to teleport in the held direction
--   Zeros roundelie's x speed, but does not change its y speed
--   Has a 2 second cooldown before roundelie can teleport again
--   This is indicated by the color of roundelie's beak, which changes when the teleport is unavailable
--   Has a hitbox that sends opponents in the direction held 1f after the teleport (not necessarily the teleport direction)
--      TODO: ^ I don't think this is actually true? I never switch input during or immediately after teleport but I regularly send opponent flying in the opposite direction
--   Roundelie is invulnerable for the first two frames of the teleport, and the hitbox is also active for those first two frames
--   There's a 3f delay before roundelie can act out of a teleport, e.g. buffering a grace-jump
-- Jump + Down lets roundelie fall through any semisolids it interacts with
--   Falling through semisolids which roundelie is standing on requires pressing jump, like other characters
-- Snowball interactions:
--   Roundelie can dive into a snowball to bounce off of it, and the resulting bounce is higher than a bounce off of the ground
--   Roundelie can teleport into a snowball to launch it in the direction that it's facing
--   Roundelie can knock a snowball into the air with the ground-slam/shockwave attack
--   Roundelie can stop a snowball from rolling either by diving into it or by knocking it into the air with the ground-slam

TODO: ((?) => "maybe", (*) => "high priority")

(core/moveset)
    - add min delay between bjump uses
        (spamming input should still work to buffer bjumps, but it'll feel better if every bjump gains some height)
    - experiment with preventing roundelie from cancelling out of dive for first few frames
        (mainly I think this will make the dive feel a bit better and sell it more as an "action")
    - (?) experiment with teleport knockback (imo current knockback doesn't really fit with the concept of a teleport, it should be a bit more chaotic or at least have variance relative to roundelie's position?)
    - (?) let roundelie influence horizontal speed slightly (but still not dive, teleport, or bjump) during conk state
    - (?) small speed boost when starting a roll or when changing roll direction
    - (?) slight bounce off of the ground after landing a midair roll at max fall-speed
    - ...
 
(visual)
    - * rosetta skin rework
    - flip doesn't handle direction changes well
        i.e. roundelie shouldn't change rotation in midair, and flip should at most take 3 rotations
            (could add new upside-down midair poses to help mitigate this?)
            (could also experiment with speeding up the flip anim the longer it's out, to avoid excessively long flips)
    - gold skin needs SOMETHING for inflate equivalent effect
        (and probably something for transitioning <-> crouch, also?)
    - hitstun changes
        - flip is default pose; animations play out to get into flip if needed
        - orientation is based on knockback
            - e.g. knockback to the right, roundelie will be oriented to the right
            - (?) can have roundelie flip into the new direction (new animation 'flip_hitstun')
        - bouncing off of the floor or wall changes orientation and causes roundelie to flip into new orientation
        - (?) experiment with tears/sroundelie face during hitstun
    - (?) fall duration check maybe should be a distance check instead? e.g. should diving through top plat on lava fields be considered a "big" fall
    - (?) experiment with adding an anim to transition to the look up pose from different orientations
    - (?) more changes to teleport vfx
            experiment drawing sparks with energy shooting between them for on-hit effect
                + a more explicit poof of smoke for the standard/non-hit effect
            (can also experiment with drawing an after-image in the origin point smoke, again, but this time using stencil?)
    - (?) experiment with sweat drops for empty bjump (out of uses)
        (could also use the "tears" effect for this, in addition to the sweat drops)

(other)
    - * audio bugs
        - diving when on the ground shouldn't play a sound effect, and similarly sound effects should only play when the action is performed
        - sfx should play on action, not queue when there's multiple sound effects in a row e.g. when dribbling
    - * sfx pass (shockwave/ground-slam, teleport, unique sounds for roundelie in general)
    - ...
